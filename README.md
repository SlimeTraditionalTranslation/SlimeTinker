SlimeTinker is a Slimefun4 addon that tries its best to recreate the amazing Tinker's Construct Mod ([link](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tinkers-construct)) in Vanilla Minecraft.

## Features include:
* The ability to melt all Vanilla, Core Slimefun, Infinity Expansion, Slimefun Warfare, DynaTech and LiteXpansion metals and alloys. 
* Casting out metals into nuggets, ingots and blocks for all valid metals. Cast into tools parts (Axe Heads, Sword Blades etc.)
* Creation of custom tools based on any combination of Head, Binding and Rod parts for a unique tool
* Each Part/metal combination has a specific property. Properties range from Auto smelting to Levitation, invisibility to 3x3 mining.
* Tools level as you use them, as they level they unlock new Modifier slots and can promote from Stone > Gold > Iron > Diamond and Netherite.
* Modifier slots can be used to add special modifiers to the tool from bonus drops (on top of looting/fortune) to more haste, damage and more.
* Tools do not break, they just stop working until you repair them using the same metal type the tool is made of
* Parts can be swapped out at will leaving the tool level/mods intact. Want to start with Copper to level faster and then swap to Reinforced for 3x3? Go for it!
* All effects/mods (when applicable) work with Vanilla Enchants. Damage, exp and durability modifications are all stackable and work nicely with each other.

## Planned Features include:
* Addition of molten metal types and traits from even more Addons.
* Armour
* Additional Smeltery with more automation features

## Suggestions?
SlimeTinker has a LOT of traits/effects, and I simply do not have enough ideas to flesh out all of it. So I really would welcome any and all suggestions in the Slimefun Addon Community Discord (be sure to stick to the slimetinker channel!). If you have ideas, or just wanna chat about this addon or any of the addons made by the great members of the addon community, join the Slimefun Addon Community Discord. <br>
