SlimeTinker is a Slimefun4 addon that tries it's best to recreate the amazing Tinker's Construct Mod ([link](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tinkers-construct)) in Vanilla Minecraft.

## Features include:
* The ability to melt all Vanilla and Core Slimefun metals and alloys. 
* Casting out metals into nuggets, ingots and blocks for all metals. Cast into tools parts (Axe Heads, Sword Blades etc.)
* Creation of custom tools based on any combination of Head, Binding and Rod parts for a unique tool
* Each Part/metal combination has a specific property. Properties range from Auto smelting to Levitation, invisibilty to 3x3 mining.
* Tools level as you use them, as they level they unlock new Modifier slots and can promote from Stone > Gold > Iron > Diamond and Netherite.
* Modifier slots can be used to add special modifiers to the tool from bonus drops (on top of looting/fortune) to more haste, damage and more.
* Tools do not break, they just stop working until you repair them using the same metal type the tool is made of
* Parts can be swapped out at will leaving the tool level/mods intact. Want to start with Copper to level faster THEN swap to Reinforced for 3x3? Go for it!
* All effects/mods (when applicable) work with Vanilla Enchants. Damage, exp and durability modifications are all stackable and work nicely with each other.

## Planned Features include:
* Addition of molten metal types from even more addons!
* Armour pieces
* Additional tiers of smeltery that will allow for further automation. 
## Suggestions?
SlimeTinker has a LOT of properties and effects and I simply do not have enough ideas to flesh out all of it. So I really would welcome any and all suggestions in the Slimefun Addon Community Discord (be sure to stick to the slimetinker channel!).
